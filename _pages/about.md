I am a first year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making at MIT.

Education

Research
======

I am broadly interested in **causal inference**, **applied statistics**, and **statistical approaches to machine learning**, with a focus on understanding and improving how data-driven methods can guide decisions in real-world contexts. In particular, I am drawn to problems at the intersection of:  

- **Statistical learning and machine learning** for modeling, prediction, and inference, including NLP and computer vision applications  
- **Uncertainty quantification** in models of complex systems  
- **Confidence procedures** designed for specific scientific and policy goals  
- **Applications in the social & physical sciences** (e.g., public policy, health, climate, economics)
